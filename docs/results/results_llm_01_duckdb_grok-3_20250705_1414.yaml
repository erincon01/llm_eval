    Monitor price variability by calculating the standard deviation with 4 decimals of order prices for each part type, year, and quarter.
    Return part type, year, quarter, count of the orders, and the standard deviation of prices, ordered by part type, year, and quarter ascending.
    Include only orders placed by customers from JAPAN.
